# ocean-condition-coral-health-report


This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing geospatial and environmental data, likely related to ocean conditions and coral bleaching. The project utilizes a variety of visualizations to explore relationships, distributions, trends, and geographic patterns within the dataset.

Project Overview

This Power BI report aims to provide insights into key environmental indicators such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and pH levels, and their potential correlation with coral bleaching events across different geographic locations. The report includes interactive visualizations that allow for a comprehensive understanding of the data.

Contents

The Power BI project (`.pbix` file in this repository) consists of two main report pages:

Page 1: Data Dashboard**

This page provides a multi-faceted overview of the key data points through the following visualizations:

* Average pH Level (Card):** Displays the overall average pH level recorded in the dataset, providing a quick summary statistic.
* SST vs. pH Level by Bleaching Severity (Scatter Chart):** Explores the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (°C) and pH levels, with data points colored to indicate the severity of coral bleaching at different locations. This visual helps identify potential correlations between these environmental factors and bleaching events.
* Distribution of Locations by Bleaching Severity (Pie Chart):** Shows the proportion of locations categorized under different levels of coral bleaching severity (e.g., None, Low, Medium, High). This provides a clear understanding of the prevalence of each severity level across the observed locations.
* Monthly Sea Surface Temperature (°C) (Line Chart):** Illustrates the trend of Sea Surface Temperature (°C) over the months recorded in the dataset. This helps identify seasonal patterns or anomalies in SST.
* Count of Species Observed (Column Chart):** Displays the number of observations for each species present in the dataset. This can highlight the frequency of different species being recorded in conjunction with the environmental data.

Page 2: Geographic Distribution of Locations (Map)

This page features a map visual displaying the spatial distribution of the various locations included in the dataset. Markers on the map likely represent these locations, potentially colored or sized to indicate additional information (e.g., bleaching severity or specific environmental conditions). This visual provides crucial geographic context for the rest of the analysis.

Potential Insights

By exploring this Power BI report, one can potentially gain insights into:

* The average pH levels across the study areas.
* Possible correlations between Sea Surface Temperature and pH levels in relation to coral bleaching.
* The distribution and frequency of different levels of coral bleaching.
* Seasonal trends in Sea Surface Temperature.
* The frequency of different species observations at the studied locations.
* The geographic spread of the data collection points.

How to Use

1.  **Download the `.pbix` file** from this repository.
2.  **Open the file in Power BI Desktop.** (You need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer).
3.  **Explore the different pages and interact with the visuals.** Power BI allows for filtering, hovering over data points for more details, and drilling down into the data (if configured).
